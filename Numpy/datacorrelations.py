# A great aspect of the Pandas module is the corr() method.

# The corr() method calculates the relationship between each column in your data set.

# The examples in this page uses a CSV file called: 'data.csv'.

import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('datacor.csv')

print(df.corr())


# The corr() method ignores "not numeric" columns.
# The Result of the corr() method is a table with a lot of numbers that represents how well the relationship is between two columns.
# The number varies from -1 to 1.
# 1 means that there is a 1 to 1 relationship (a perfect correlation), and for this data set, 
# each time a value went up in the first column, the other one went up as well.
# 0.9 is also a good relationship, and if you increase one value, the other will probably increase as well.
# -0.9 would be just as good relationship as 0.9, but if you increase one value, the other will probably go down.
# 0.2 means NOT a good relationship, meaning that if one value goes up does not mean that the other will.
# What is a good correlation? It depends on the use, 
# but I think it is safe to say you have to have at least 0.6 (or -0.6) to call it a good correlation.
